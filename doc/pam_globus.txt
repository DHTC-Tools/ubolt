SYNOPSIS
========

  ``pam_globus`` is a Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) component.
  It must be set up in a PAM configuration file to operate.

  Usage depends on platform.  For Solaris, usage will be something like
  (in ``/etc/pam.conf``)::

    other account required pam_globus.so
    sshd-kbdint account required pam_globus.so
    sshd-kbdint session required pam_globus.so

  For Linux, usage will be slightly different.  For example, in
  ``/etc/pam.d/password-auth``::

    auth  required      pam_env.so
    auth  sufficient    pam_globus.so
    auth  sufficient    pam_unix.so nullok try_first_pass
    auth  requisite     pam_succeed_if.so uid >= 500 quiet
    auth  required      pam_deny.so


DESCRIPTION
===========

  pam_globus.so permits password authentication using Globus Online
  (https://globusonline.org) identity.  WHen pam_globus is in play,
  users of your POSIX system whose local identities match a Globus
  Online identity may authenticate using that Globus Online identity's
  password.  This is accomplished using the Globus Nexus REST API.

  Passwords are collected in cleartext and sent over an SSL connection to
  the Nexus API.  Cleartext passwords are not stored or logged locally.


CONFIGURATION
=============

  The module should reside in the default location for PAM modules if you
  do not give path information.  If you do not want to install there,
  provide the full path to the module.  On Solaris (at least) PAM modules
  must be owned by root and NOT writable by non-root users.

  Linux keeps PAM modules in ``/lib/security`` or in ``/lib64/security``.

  Your particular environment decides the service name. "sshd-kbdint" is
  used for keyboard authentication under OpenSSH, but "login" is used for
  local logins.  If you do not know what service to use, try "other" and
  watch your logs to see what service is identified by a login attempt.
  You may need to configure syslog to record LOG_DEBUG messages.

  Pam_globus currently provides no functionality for SESSION or ACCOUNT
  services.  It applies only to AUTH.

  pam_globus.so logs to syslog, usign LOG_AUTH.
