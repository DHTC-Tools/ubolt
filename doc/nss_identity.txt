SYNOPSIS
========

  In ``/etc/nsswitch.conf``::

    group: files identity


DESCRIPTION
===========

  nss_identity provides a means of fabricating POSIX nameservice entries
  based upon information present in the request and (perhaps) elsewhere
  within the nsswitch framework, but without reference to an external
  source of authority.  This is primarily useful for fabricating
  identities: a 1:1 mapping of numeric IDs to predictably corresponding
  text representations.

EXAMPLE
=======

  Assume that no group with ``gid=1234`` or ``gid=5555`` is defined
  explicitly, and that the following user exists::

    bork:x:1234:1234:Chef Bork:/home/bork:/bin/borsh

  The following commands will return results as indicated::

    $ getent group 1234
    [no results]
    $ getent group 5555
    [no results]
    $ getent group bork
    [no results]

  Now assume the following line in /etc/nsswitch.conf::

    group: identity

  These results should occur::

    $ getent group 1234
    bork::1234:bork
    $ getent group 5555
    group_5555::5555:
    $ getent group bork
    bork::1234:bork
    $ getent group group_1234
    group_1234::1234:bork

  The nss_identity nss module fabricates identities based on available
  nsswitch information.

  Currently only the GROUP service is supported.  Other services may be
  added if useful.

USE CASE
========

  An identity mapping of groups to users is primarily useful where
  your site is using some external source of user information, such as
  nss_ldap, and where that source does NOT provide corresponding POSIX
  group information.

  For example, suppose a site uses this nsswitch configuration::

    passwd: files ldap

  Thousands of users may be virtually defined on this system through
  the use of nss_ldap, but if LDAP does not provide group definitions,
  then those users' gids will not map back to valid group entries.
  As far as UNIX is concerned that is OK, but some software may take
  issue with being unable to reverse a user's GID to a group entry.

  Suppose that we add the following to nsswitch.conf::

    group: files identity

  Now groups may be defined explicitly in /etc/group, but any group
  that does not exist locally will be resolved in nss_identity.  This
  guarantees that a reverse mapping is possible even when there is no
  local group definition.


TO DO
=====

  This is adequate to current need, but it might be nice to have the
  option to fail lookup of GIDs that do not correspond to any known
  user, rather than fabricating a group entry.  This is probably best
  accomplished with two separate builds of the nss library, but the
  behavior can be switched using cpp a macro instead of two distinct
  code paths.
